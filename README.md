# Iris dataset

This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. The dataset consists of measurements of four features  or attributes of iris flowers:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

And these measurements are taken from three different species of iris flowers:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

For each species, there are 50 samples, making a total of 150 samples in the dataset (this particular dataset is a bit adjusted). More info on [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
The Iris dataset is often used for ML demonstrations and tutorials. The dataset has a simple and clean structure, it is small, well-organized, and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes. 

The **purpose of the project** is to have a hands on full data analytics experience from A to Z with the use of a small dataset. 

Starting with raw data and reading it into python we'll be then doing some analytical and statstical observations on the data and then some supervised and unsupervised learning on the data. 

The project consists of four parts, they are mostly independent

- Part1: Data Loading and Cleaning up
- Part 2: Stastical Exploring
- Part 3: Statistical Analysis
- Part 4: Machine Learning
