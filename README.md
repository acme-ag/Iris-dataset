# Iris dataset

This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. The dataset consists of measurements of four features  or attributes of iris flowers:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
And these measurements are taken from three different species of iris flowers:

- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica
For each species, there are 50 samples, making a total of 150 samples in the dataset (well, this particular dataset is a bit adjusted so the actual number here is slightly different).
The Iris dataset is often used for ML demonstrations and tutorials.

It has a simple and clean structure, it is small, well-organized, and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes.
